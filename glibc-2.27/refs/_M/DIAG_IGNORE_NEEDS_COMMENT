<doc f='codebrowser/include/libc-diag.h' l='44'>/* Ignore the diagnostic OPTION.  VERSION is the most recent GCC
   version for which the diagnostic has been confirmed to appear in
   the absence of the pragma (in the form MAJOR.MINOR for GCC 4.x,
   just MAJOR for GCC 5 and later).  Uses of this pragma should be
   reviewed when the GCC version given is no longer supported for
   building glibc; the version number should always be on the same
   source line as the macro name, so such uses can be found with grep.
   Uses should come with a comment giving more details of the
   diagnostic, and an architecture on which it is seen if possibly
   optimization-related and not in architecture-specific code.  This
   macro should only be used if the diagnostic seems hard to fix (for
   example, optimization-related false positives).  */</doc>
