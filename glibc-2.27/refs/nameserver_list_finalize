   pointer to it.  The pointer is NULL if memory allocation fails, or
   if the array is empty, so this function should be used only for
   arrays which are known not be empty (usually because they always
   have a sentinel at the end).  If LENGTHP is not NULL, the array
   length is written to *LENGTHP.  *LIST is re-initialized and can be
   reused.  */</doc>
