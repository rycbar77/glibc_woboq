   Otherwise, initializes state[] based on the given &quot;seed&quot; via a linear
   congruential generator.  Then, the pointers are set to known locations
   that are exactly rand_sep places apart.  Lastly, it cycles the state
   information a given number of times to get rid of any initial dependencies
