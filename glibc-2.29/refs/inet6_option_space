   This function returns the number of bytes required to hold an option
   when it is stored as ancillary data, including the cmsghdr structure
   at the beginning, and any padding at the end (to make its size a
   multiple of 8 bytes).  The argument is the size of the structure
   defining the option, which must include any pad bytes at the
   beginning (the value y in the alignment term &quot;xn + y&quot;), the type
   byte, the length byte, and the option data.  */</doc>
