<doc f='codebrowser/iconv/gconv_charset.h' l='29'>/* An iconv encoding is in the form of a triplet, with parts separated by
   a &apos;/&apos; character.  The first part is the standard name, the second part is
   the character set, and the third part is the error handler.  If the first
   part is sufficient to identify both the standard and the character set
   then the second part can be empty e.g. UTF-8//.  If the first part is not
   sufficient to identify both the standard and the character set then the
   second part is required e.g. ISO-10646/UTF8/.  If neither the first or
   second parts are provided e.g. //, then the current locale is used.
   The actual values used in the first and second parts are not entirely
   relevant to the implementation.  The values themselves are used in a hash
   table to lookup modules and so the naming convention of the first two parts
   is somewhat arbitrary and only helps locate the entries in the cache.
   The third part is the error handler and is comprised of a &apos;,&apos; or &apos;/&apos;
   separated list of suffixes.  Currently, we support &quot;TRANSLIT&quot; for
   transliteration and &quot;IGNORE&quot; for ignoring conversion errors due to
   unrecognized input characters.  */</doc>
