  M_MMAP_MAX is the maximum number of requests to simultaneously
  service using mmap. This parameter exists because
  some systems have a limited number of internal tables for
  use by mmap, and using more than a few of them may degrade
  performance.

  The default is set to a value that serves only as a safeguard.
  Setting to 0 disables use of mmap for servicing large requests.
