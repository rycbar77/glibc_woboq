   NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT indicates that MORECORE does not return contiguous
   regions.  Otherwise, contiguity is exploited in merging together,
   when possible, results from consecutive MORECORE calls.

   The initial value comes from MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS, but is
   changed dynamically if mmap is ever used as an sbrk substitute.
