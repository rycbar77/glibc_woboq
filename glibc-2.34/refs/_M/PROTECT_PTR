<doc f='codebrowser/malloc/malloc.c' l='341'>/* Safe-Linking:
   Use randomness from ASLR (mmap_base) to protect single-linked lists
   of Fast-Bins and TCache.  That is, mask the &quot;next&quot; pointers of the
   lists&apos; chunks, and also perform allocation alignment checks on them.
   This mechanism reduces the risk of pointer hijacking, as was done with
   Safe-Unlinking in the double-linked lists of Small-Bins.
   It assumes a minimum page size of 4096 bytes (12 bits).  Systems with
   larger pages provide less entropy, although the pointer mangling
   still works.  */</doc>
