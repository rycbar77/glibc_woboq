   Returns the number of bytes consumed in DST or -1 (with errno set).

   DNPTRS is an array of pointers to previous compressed names.
   DNPTRS[0] is a pointer to the beginning of the message.

   The list ends with NULL.  LASTDNPTR is a pointer to the end of the
   array pointed to by DNPTRS.  Side effect is to update the list of
   pointers for labels inserted into the message as we compress the
   name.  If DNPTRS is NULL, we don&apos;t try to compress names.  If
   LASTDNPTR * is NULL, we don&apos;t update the list.  */</doc>
