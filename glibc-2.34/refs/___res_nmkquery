   STATP points to an initialized resolver state.  OP is the opcode of
   the query.  DNAME is the domain.  CLASS and TYPE are the DNS query
   class and type.  DATA can be NULL; otherwise, it is a pointer to a
   domain name which is included in the generated packet (if op ==
   NS_NOTIFY_OP).  BUF must point to the out buffer of BUFLEN bytes.

   DATALEN and NEWRR_IN are currently ignored.  */</doc>
