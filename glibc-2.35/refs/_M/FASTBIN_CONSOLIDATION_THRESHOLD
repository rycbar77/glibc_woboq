   FASTBIN_CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD is the size of a chunk in free()
   that triggers automatic consolidation of possibly-surrounding
   fastbin chunks. This is a heuristic, so the exact value should not
   matter too much. It is defined at half the default trim threshold as a
   compromise heuristic to only attempt consolidation if it is likely
   to lead to trimming. However, it is not dynamically tunable, since
   consolidation reduces fragmentation surrounding large chunks even
   if trimming is not used.
