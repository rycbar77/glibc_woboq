<doc f='codebrowser/include/shlib-compat.h' l='27'>/* The file abi-versions.h (generated by scripts/abi-versions.awk) defines
   symbols like `ABI_libm_GLIBC_2_0&apos; for each version set in the source
   code for each library.  For a version set that is subsumed by a later
   version set, the definition gives the subsuming set, i.e. if GLIBC_2_0
   is subsumed by GLIBC_2_1, then ABI_libm_GLIBC_2_0 == ABI_libm_GLIBC_2_1.
   Each version set that is to be distinctly defined in the output has an
   unique positive integer value, increasing with newer versions.  Thus,
   evaluating two ABI_* symbols reduces to integer values that differ only
   when the two version sets named are in fact two different ABIs we are
   supporting.  If these do not differ, then there is no need to compile in
   extra code to support this version set where it has been superseded by a
   newer version.  */</doc>
