<doc f='codebrowser/math/math-narrow.h' l='33'>/* Carry out a computation using round-to-odd.  The computation is
   EXPR; the union type in which to store the result is UNION and the
   subfield of the &quot;ieee&quot; field of that union with the low part of the
   mantissa is MANTISSA; SUFFIX is the suffix for both underlying libm
   functions for the argument type (for computations where a libm
   function rather than a C operator is used when argument and result
   types are the same) and the libc_fe* macros to ensure that the
   correct rounding mode is used, for platforms with multiple rounding
   modes where those macros set only the relevant mode.
   CLEAR_UNDERFLOW indicates whether underflow exceptions must be
   cleared (in the case where a round-toward-zero underflow might not
   indicate an underflow after narrowing, when that narrowing only
   reduces precision not exponent range and the architecture uses
   before-rounding tininess detection).  This macro does not work
   correctly if the sign of an exact zero result depends on the
   rounding mode, so that case must be checked for separately.  */</doc>
