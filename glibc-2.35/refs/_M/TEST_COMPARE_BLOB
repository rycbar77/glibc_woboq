   RIGHT_LENGTH) and report a test failure if the arrays are
   different.  LEFT_LENGTH and RIGHT_LENGTH are measured in bytes.  If
   the length is null, the corresponding pointer is ignored (i.e., it
   can be NULL).  The blobs should be reasonably short because on
   mismatch, both are printed.  */</doc>
