   0:  the number is required to be 0..(2^rsize)-1, if not, NV is set plus
       the result is either 0 or (2^rsize)-1 depending on the sign in such
       case.
   1:  the number is required to be -(2^(rsize-1))..(2^(rsize-1))-1, if not,
       NV is set plus the result is either -(2^(rsize-1)) or (2^(rsize-1))-1
       depending on the sign in such case.
   2:  the number is required to be -(2^(rsize-1))..(2^(rsize-1))-1, if not,
       NV is set plus the result is reduced modulo 2^rsize.
   -1: the number is required to be -(2^(rsize-1))..(2^rsize)-1, if not, NV is
       set plus the result is either -(2^(rsize-1)) or (2^(rsize-1))-1
