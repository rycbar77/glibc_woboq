   DNPTRS is an array of pointers to previous compressed names.
   DNPTRS[0] is a pointer to the beginning of the message. The array
   ends with NULL.  LASTDNPTR is a pointer to the end of the array
   pointed to by &apos;dnptrs&apos;.

   The list of pointers in DNPTRS is updated for labels inserted into
   the message as we compress the name.  If DNPTRS is NULL, we don&apos;t
   try to compress names. If LASTDNPTR is NULL, we don&apos;t update the
   list.  */</doc>
