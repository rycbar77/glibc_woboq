<doc f='codebrowser/nscd/connections.c' l='886'>/* Register the file in FINFO as a traced file for the database DBS[DBIX].

   We support registering multiple files per database. Each call to
   register_traced_file adds to the list of registered files.

   When we prune the database, either through timeout or a request to
   invalidate, we will check to see if any of the registered files has changed.
   When we accept new connections to handle a cache request we will also
   check to see if any of the registered files has changed.

   If we have inotify support then we install an inotify fd to notify us of
   file deletion or modification, both of which will require we invalidate
   the cache for the database.  Without inotify support we stat the file and
   store st_mtime to determine if the file has been modified.  */</doc>
