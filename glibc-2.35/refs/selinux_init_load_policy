 * Perform the initial policy load.
 * This function determines the desired enforcing mode, sets the
 * the *enforce argument accordingly for the caller to use, sets the 
 * SELinux kernel enforcing status to match it, and loads the policy.
 * It also internally handles the initial selinuxfs mount required to
 * perform these actions.
 *
 * The function returns 0 if everything including the policy load succeeds.
 * In this case, init is expected to re-exec itself in order to transition
 * to the proper security context.
 * Otherwise, the function returns -1, and init must check *enforce to
 * determine how to proceed.  If enforcing (*enforce &gt; 0), then init should
 * halt the system.  Otherwise, init may proceed normally without a re-exec.
