 * selinux_set_mapping - Enable dynamic mapping between integer offsets and security class names
 * @map: array of security_class_mapping structures
 *
 * The core avc_has_perm() API uses integers to represent security
 * classes; previous to the introduction of this function, it was
 * common for userspace object managers to be compiled using generated
 * offsets for a particular policy.  However, that strongly ties the build of the userspace components to a particular policy.
 *
 * By using this function to map between integer offsets and security
 * class names, it&apos;s possible to replace a system policies that have
 * at least the same set of security class names as used by the
 * userspace object managers.
 *
 * To correctly use this function, you should override the generated
 * security class defines from the system policy in a local header,
 * starting at 1, and have one security_class_mapping structure entry
 * per define.
