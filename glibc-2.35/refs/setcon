   Note that use of this function requires that the entire application
   be trusted to maintain any desired separation between the old and new 
   security contexts, unlike exec-based transitions performed via setexeccon.  
   When possible, decompose your application and use setexeccon()+execve() 
   instead. Note that the application may lose access to its open descriptors
   as a result of a setcon() unless policy allows it to use descriptors opened
   by the old context. */</doc>
